this is my final project I completed with Juliet Wield and Miguel Solis. 
it is supposed to be an UNO game, with client-server connection.
To make it work:
1. run "UnoServer.java" via terminal, with java UnoServer ####, where you decide the port number. 
2. open 2 new terminal, and run "UnoGUI.java" by "java UnoGUI". type in your username, the IPaddress as "localhost", and the port number ####
play uno.
